# TwentyRestaurantsFour

Welcome to TwentyRestaurantsFour! This app allows users to find the Top TwentyRestaurantsFour Restaurants in London and a short description. It will iterate through a collection of restaurants from DiscoEats discount platform.
The first level scrap displays the information of the Restaurants name, location and cuisine. The user will then choose which restaurant they get more information on by choosing a number from 1-10.
The app will then scrap the description using the specific Restaurants url. The description is then displayed on the terminal. User will also have the choice to choose another restaurant to read description or exit the app.
